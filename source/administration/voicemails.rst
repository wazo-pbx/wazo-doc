General Configuration
=====================

The global voicemail configuration is provided by ``/asterisk/voicemail`` endpoints

To customize the email sent when a voicemail is received, you can use a few variables. The complete
list is available on the `Asterisk wiki
<https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/VoiceMail+Channel+Variables>`_.


Deleting a voicemail
====================

* Deleting a voicemail is irreversible. It deletes all messages associated with that voicemail.
* If the voicemail contains messages, the message waiting indication on the phone will not be
  deactivated until the next phone reboot.


Disable password checking
=========================

Unchecking the option ``ask_password`` field allows you to skip password checking for the voicemail
only when it is consulted from an internal context.

* when calling the voicemail with \*98
* when calling the voicemail with \*99<voicemail number>

.. warning::

   If the the \*99 extension is enabled and a user does not have a password on its voicemail, anyone
   from the same context will be able to listen to its messages, change its password and greeting
   messages.

.. warning::

   For security reasons, an incoming call with ``{"destination": {"appplication: "voicemail"}`` with
   the same context as the voicemail should be avoided if a voicemail has no password.


Advanced configuration
======================

Remote *wazo-confd*
-------------------

If *wazo-confd* is on a remote host, *wazo-confd-client* configuration will be
required to be able to change the voicemail passwords using a phone.

This configuration should be done:

.. code-block:: sh

    mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/asterisk.service.d
    cat >/etc/systemd/system/asterisk.service.d/remote-confd-voicemail.conf <<EOF
    [Service]
    Environment=CONFD_HOST=localhost
    Environment=CONFD_PORT=9486
    Environment=CONFD_HTTPS=true
    Environment=CONFD_USERNAME=<username>
    Environment=CONFD_PASSWORD=<password>
    EOF
    systemctl daemon-reload
