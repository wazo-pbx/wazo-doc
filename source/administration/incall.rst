Incall

General Configuration
=====================

You can configure incoming calls with ``/incalls`` endpoints.


:abbr:`DID (Direct Inward Dialing)` Configuration
-------------------------------------------------

When a "+" character is prepended a called DID, the "+" character is discarded.

Example:

   Bob has a DID with number 1000. Alice can call Bob by dialing either 1000 or +1000, without configuring another DID.


BlackList
=========

There are no interface to set a blacklist, but you can build if by hand.

  * You need a preprocess subroutine on the incall with the following dialplan::

      [check-blacklist]
      exten = s,1,GotoIf(${BLACKLIST()}?blacklisted)
      same = n,Return()
      same = n(blacklisted),Playback(no-user-find)
      same = n,Hangup()

  * Do a ``dialplan reload`` in the Asterisk CLI to load the new dialplan

You can manage the blacklist in the Asterisk CLI

  * To add extension::

    *CLI> database put blacklist <extension> "<description (e.g. reason)>"

  * To remove extension::

    *CLI> database del blacklist <extension>
