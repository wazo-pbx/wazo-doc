This section describes how to configure the telephony hardware on a Wazo server.

.. note:: Currently Wazo supports only Digium Telephony Interface cards

The configuration process is the following :

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   first, load the correct DAHDI modules, <load_modules>
   then, configure and install the echo-canceller, <echo_canceller>
   configure the card, <card_configuration>
   and finally, apply the configuration. <apply_configuration>

At the end of this page you will also find some general notes and DAHDI.


Notes on configuration files
============================


.. _system_conf:

/etc/dahdi/system.conf
----------------------

A *span* is created for each card port. Below is an example of a standard E1 port::

   span=1,1,0,ccs,hdb3
   dchan=16
   bchan=1-15,17-31
   echocanceller=mg2,1-15,17-31

Each span has to be declared with the following information::

   span=<spannum>,<timing>,<LBO>,<framing>,<coding>[,crc4]

* ``spannum`` : corresponds to the span number. It starts to 1 and has to be incremented by 1 at each new span.
  This number MUST be unique.
* ``timing`` : describes the how this span will be considered regarding the synchronization :

  * 0 : do not use this span as a synchronization source,
  * 1 : use this span as the primary synchronization source,
  * 2 : use this span as the secondary synchronization source etc.

* ``LBO`` : 0 (not used)
* ``framing`` : correct values are ``ccs`` or ``cas``.
  For ISDN lines, ``ccs`` is used.
* ``coding`` : correct values are ``hdb3`` or ``ami``.
  For example, ``hdb3`` is used for an E1 (PRI) link, whereas ``ami`` is used for T0 (french BRI) link.
* ``crc4`` : this is a framing option for PRI lines.
  For example it is rarely use in France.

Note that the ``dahdi_genconf`` command should usually give you the correct parameters (if you correctly set the cards
jumper). All these information should be checked with your operator.


/etc/asterisk/chan_dahdi.conf
-----------------------------

This file contains the general parameters of the DAHDI channel.
It is not generated via the ``dahdi_genconf`` command.


.. _asterisk_dahdi_channel_conf:

/etc/asterisk/dahdi-channels.conf
---------------------------------

This file contains the parameters of each channel.
It is generated via the ``dahdi_genconf`` command.

Below is an example of span definition::

  group=0,11
  context=from-extern
  switchtype = euroisdn
  signalling = pri_cpe
  channel => 1-15,17-31

Note that parameters are read from top to bottom in a last match fashion and are applied to the
given channels when it reads a line ``channel =>``.

Here the channels 1 to 15 and 17 to 31 (it is a typical E1) are set:

* in groups 0 and 11 (see :ref:`interco_dahdi_conf`)
* in context ``from-extern`` : all calls received on these channels will be sent in the context ``from-extern``
* and configured with switchtype ``euroisdn`` and signalling ``pri_cpe``

Check IRQ misses
----------------

It's always useful to verify if there isn't any *missed IRQ* problem with the cards.

Check::

   cat /proc/dahdi/<span number>

If the *IRQ misses* counter increments, it's not good::

   cat /proc/dahdi/1
   Span 1: WCTDM/0 "Wildcard TDM800P Board 1" (MASTER)
   IRQ misses: 1762187
     1 WCTDM/0/0 FXOKS (In use)
     2 WCTDM/0/1 FXOKS (In use)
     3 WCTDM/0/2 FXOKS (In use)
     4 WCTDM/0/3 FXOKS (In use)

Digium gives some hints in their *Knowledge Base* here : https://support.digium.com/community/s/search/All/Home/IRQ

PRI Digium cards needs 1000 interruption per seconds. If the system cannot supply them,
it increment the IRQ missed counter.

As indicated in Digium *KB* you should avoid shared IRQ with other equipments (like HD or NIC interfaces).
