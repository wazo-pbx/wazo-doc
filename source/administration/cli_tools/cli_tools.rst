.. _wazo_reset:

wazo-reset
----------

wazo-reset is a tool to reset some of the state of a Wazo installation to a pre-wizard state.  It
does not try to reset everything and will *not* give the same result as a fresh new Wazo
installation. For example, all customizations that you have made that are not stored in the database
(e.g. installing Debian packages, adding custom configuration files, etc), will not be reset. This
tool should be used with extra care.

After using it, you need to pass the wizard once again.


wazo-upgrade
------------

``wazo-upgrade`` is used to upgrade Wazo to a later version. Beginning with Wazo 17.17,
``wazo-upgrade`` will not upgrade to a later Debian version. For this, you have to use
