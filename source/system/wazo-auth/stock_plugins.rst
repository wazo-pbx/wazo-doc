wazo_user
---------

Backend name: ``wazo_user``

Purpose: Authenticate a user created by wazo-auth. These users do not map to telephony users at the moment.

Supported policy variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* username: The username of the user
* groups: A list of groups associated to this user

  * group.uuid: The group UUID
  * group.name: The group name
  * group.users: A list of users associated to this group each user having the following fields

    * username
    * uuid


* tenants: A list of tenants associated to this user

  * tenant.uuid: The tenant UUID
  * tenant.name: The tenant name

* uuid: The UUID of the user authenticating
* voicemails: a list of voicemail ID associated to this user
* lines: a list of line ID associated to this user
* extensions: a list of extension ID associated to this user
* endpoint_sip: a list of SIP endpoint ID associated to this user
* endpoing_sccp: a list of SCCP endpoint ID associated to this user
* endpoint_custom: a list of custum endpoint ID associated to this user
* agent: a dictionnary containing the agent's property, may be none and should be tested with an if before accessing its fields
* agent.id: an agent id if the user is an agent
* agent.number: an agent number if the user is an agent


.. _auth-backends-ldap:

LDAP
----

Backend name: ``ldap_user``

Purpose: Authenticate with an LDAP user.

For example, with the given configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   enabled_backend_plugins:
       ldap_user: true
   ldap:
       uri: ldap://example.org
       bind_dn: cn=wazo,dc=example,dc=org
       bind_password: bindpass
       user_base_dn: ou=people,dc=example,dc=org
       user_login_attribute: uid
       user_email_attribute: mail

When an authentication request is received for username ``alice`` and password ``userpass``, the
backend will:

#. Connect to the LDAP server at example.org
#. Do an LDAP "bind" operation with bind DN ``cn=wazo,dc=example,dc=org`` and password ``bindpass``
#. Do an LDAP "search" operation to find an LDAP user matching ``alice``, using:

   * the base DN ``ou=people,dc=example,dc=org``
   * the filter ``(uid=alice)``
   * a SUBTREE scope

#. If the search returns exactly 1 LDAP user, do an LDAP "bind" operation with the user's DN and the
   password ``userpass``
#. If the LDAP "bind" operation is successful, search in Wazo a user with an email matching the
   ``mail`` attribute of the LDAP user
#. If a Wazo user is found, success

To use an anonymous bind instead, the following configuration would be used:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ldap:
       uri: ldap://example.org
       bind_anonymous: True
       user_base_dn: ou=people,dc=example,dc=org
       user_login_attribute: uid
       user_email_attribute: mail

The backend can also works in a "no search" mode, for example with the following configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ldap:
       uri: ldap://example.org
       user_base_dn: ou=people,dc=example,dc=org
       user_login_attribute: uid
       user_email_attribute: mail

When the server receives the same authentication request as above, it will directly do an
LDAP "bind" operation with the DN ``uid=alice,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org`` and password
``userpass``, and continue at step 5.

.. note:: User's email and voicemail's email are two separate things. This plugin only use the
   user's email.
