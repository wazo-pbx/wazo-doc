wazo-auth
=========

wazo-auth is a scalable, extendable and configurable authentication service.
It uses an HTTP interface to emit tokens to users who can then use those tokens
to identify and authenticate themselves with other services compatible with
wazo-auth.

The HTTP API reference is at http://api.wazo.community.

Usage
=====

wazo-auth is used through HTTP requests, using HTTPS. Its default port is 9497.
As a user, the most common operation is to get a new token. This is done with
the POST method.

Alice retrieves a token using her username/password::

    $ # Alice creates a new token, using the xivo_user backend, expiring in 10 minutes
    $ curl -k -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u 'alice:s3cre7' "https://localhost:9497/0.1/token" -d '{"backend": "xivo_user", "expiration": 600}';echo
    {"data": {"issued_at": "2015-06-05T10:16:58.557553", "utc_issued_at": "2015-06-05T15:16:58.557553", "token": "1823c1ee-6c6a-0cdc-d869-964a7f08a744", "auth_id": "63f3dc3c-865d-419e-bec2-e18c4b118224", "xivo_user_uuid": "63f3dc3c-865d-419e-bec2-e18c4b118224", "expires_at": "2015-06-05T11:16:58.557595", "utc_expires_at": "2015-06-05T16:16:58.557595"}}

In this example Alice used here login ``alice`` and password ``s3cre7``. The authentication source
is determined by the :ref:`backend <auth-backends>` in the POST data.

Alice could also have specified an expiration time on her POST request. The
expiration value is the number of seconds before the token expires.

After retrieving her token, Alice can query other services that use wazo-auth
and send her token to those service. Those services can then use this token
on Alice's behalf to access her personal storage.

If Alice wants to revoke her token before its expiration::

    $ curl -k -X DELETE -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "https://localhost:9497/0.1/token/1823c1ee-6c6a-0cdc-d869-964a7f08a744"

See http://api.wazo.community for more details about the HTTP API.

See :ref:`service-authentication` for details about the authentication process.


Usage for services using wazo-auth
==================================

A service that requires authentication and identification can use wazo-auth to
externalise the burden of authentication. The new service can then accept a
token as part of its operations to authenticate the user using the service.

Once a service receives a token from one of its user, it will need to check the
validity of that token. There are 2 forms of verification, one that only checks
if the token is valid and the other returns information about this token's
session if it is valid.

Checking if a token is valid::

    $ curl -k -i -X HEAD -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "https://localhost:9497/0.1/token/1823c1ee-6c6a-0cdc-d869-964a7f08a744"

    $ # get more information about this token
    $ curl -k -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "https://localhost:9497/0.1/token/1823c1ee-6c6a-0cdc-d869-964a7f08a744";echo
    {"data": {"issued_at": "2015-06-05T10:16:58.557553", "utc_issued_at": "2015-06-05T15:16:58.557553", "token": "1823c1ee-6c6a-0cdc-d869-964a7f08a744", "auth_id": "63f3dc3c-865d-419e-bec2-e18c4b118224", "xivo_user_uuid": "63f3dc3c-865d-419e-bec2-e18c4b118224", "expires_at": "2015-06-05T11:16:58.557595", "utc_expires_at": "2015-06-05T16:16:58.557595"}}


Launching wazo-auth
===================

::

    usage: wazo-auth [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-u USER] [-d] [-f] [-l LOG_LEVEL]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                            The path to the config file
      -u USER, --user USER  User to run the daemon
      -d, --debug           Log debug messages
      -f, --foreground      Foreground, don't daemonize
      -l LOG_LEVEL, --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                            Logs messages with LOG_LEVEL details. Must be one of:
                            critical, error, warning, info, debug. Default: None


Configuration
=============

Policies
--------

Policies can be assigned to backends in order to generate the appropriate permissions
for a token created with this backend.

To change to policy associated to a backend, add a new configuration file in ``/etc/wazo-auth/conf.d``
with the following content:

.. code-block:: yaml

    backend_policies:
      <backend_name>: <policy_name>

* backend_name: The name of the backend to associate to a new policy
* policy_name: The name of the policy to assign to the backend

.. note::

    Each backend may support different variables. A policy tailored for a user oriented
    backend will probably not be usable if assigned to an administrator backend.


Policies
========

A policy is a list of ACL templates that is used to generate the ACL of a token. Policies
can be created, deleted or modified using the REST API.


ACL templates
-------------

ACL templates use `jinja2 templates`_. Each backend is responsible of supplying a list of variables
to the template engine for rendering.

.. _jinja2 templates: http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/#

A backend supplying the following variables:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {"uuid": "fd64193f-7260-4299-9bc2-87c0106e5302",
     "lines": [1, 42],
     "agent": {"id": 50, "number": "1001"}}


With the following ACL templates:

.. code-block:: none

    confd.users.{{ uuid }}.read
    {% for line in lines %}confd.lines.{{ line }}.#:{% endfor %}
    dird.me.#
    {% if agent %}agentd.agents.by-id.{{ agent.id }}.read{% endif %}

.. note:: When using ``for`` loops to create ACL, make sure to add a ``:`` separator at the end of
          each ACL

Would create tokens with the following ACL:

.. code-block:: none

    confd.users.fd64193f-7260-4299-9bc2-87c0106e5302.read
    confd.lines.1.#
    confd.lines.42.#
    dird.me.#
    agentd.agentd.by-id.50.read
