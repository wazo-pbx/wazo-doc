DHCP Server
*******************

Wazo includes a DHCP server used for assisting in the provisioning of phones and other devices. (See
:ref:`Basic Configuration <dhcpd-config>` for the basic setup). This section contains additional
notes on how to configure more advanced options that may be helpful when integrating the server with
different VOIP subnets.


Activating DHCP on another interface
====================================

DHCP Server can be activated through ``/dhcp`` endpoint

By default, it will only answer to DHCP requests coming from the VoIP subnet. If you need to
activate DHCP on an other interface, you have to fill in the ``network_interfaces`` field with
the interface name , for example : ``eth0``


Changing default DHCP gateway 
=============================

By default, the Wazo DHCP server uses the Wazo's IP address as the routing address.  To change this
you must create a custom-template:

#. Create a custom template for the :file:`dhcpd_subnet.conf.head` file::

    mkdir -p /etc/xivo/custom-templates/dhcp/etc/dhcp/
    cd /etc/xivo/custom-templates/dhcp/etc/dhcp/
    cp /usr/share/xivo-config/templates/dhcp/etc/dhcp/dhcpd_subnet.conf.head .

#. Edit the custom template::

    vim dhcpd_subnet.conf.head

#. In the file, replace the string ``#XIVO_NET4_IP#`` by the routing address of your VoIP network,
   for example::

    option routers 192.168.2.254;

#. Re-generate the dhcp configuration::

    xivo-update-config

DHCP server should have been restarted and should now use the new routing address.


Configuring DHCP server to serve unknown hosts
==============================================

By default, the Wazo DHCP server serves only known hosts. That is:

* either hosts which MAC address prefix (the `OUI
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizationally_unique_identifier>`_) is known
* or hosts which Vendor Identifier is known

Known OUIs and Vendor Class Identifiers are declared in :file:`/etc/dhcp/dhcpd_update/*` files.

If you want your Wazo DHCP server to serve also unknown hosts (like PCs) follow these instructions:

#. Create a custom template for the :file:`dhcpd_subnet.conf.tail` file::

    mkdir -p /etc/xivo/custom-templates/dhcp/etc/dhcp/
    cd /etc/xivo/custom-templates/dhcp/etc/dhcp/
    cp /usr/share/xivo-config/templates/dhcp/etc/dhcp/dhcpd_subnet.conf.tail .

#. Edit the custom template::

    vim dhcpd_subnet.conf.tail

#. And add the following line at the head of the file::

    allow unknown-clients;

#. Re-generate the dhcp configuration::

    xivo-update-config

DHCP server should have been restarted and should now serve all network equipments.


DHCP-Relay
==========

If your telephony devices aren't located on the same site and the same broadcast domain as the Wazo
DHCP server, you will have to add the option *DHCP Relay* to the site's router.  This parameter will
allow the DHCP requests from distant devices to be transmitted to the IP address you specify as DHCP
Relay.

.. warning:: Please make sure that the IP address used as DHCP Relay is the same as one of Wazo's
   interfaces, and that this interface is configured to listen to DHCP requests (as decribed in
   previous part). Also verify that routing is configured between the distant router and the choosen
   interface, otherwise DHCP requests will never reach the Wazo server.


Configuring DHCP server for other subnets
=========================================

This section describes how to configure Wazo to serve other subnets that the VOIP subnet. As you
can't use the Web Interface to declare other subnets (for example to address DATA subnet, or a VOIP
subnet that isn't on the same site that Wazo server), you'll have to do the following configuration
on the Command Line Interface.


Creating "extra subnet" configuration files
-------------------------------------------

First thing to do is to create a directory and to copy into it the configuration files::

    mkdir /etc/dhcp/dhcpd_sites/
    cp /etc/dhcp/dhcpd_subnet.conf /etc/dhcp/dhcpd_sites/dhcpd_siteXXX.conf
    cp /etc/dhcp/dhcpd_subnet.conf /etc/dhcp/dhcpd_sites/dhcpd_lanDATA.conf

.. note::
   In this case we'll create 2 files for 2 differents subnets. You can change the name of the files,
   and create as many files as you want in the folder :file:`/etc/dhcp/dhcpd_sites/`. Just adapt
   this procedure by changing the name of the file in the different links.

After creating one or several files in :file:`/etc/dhcp/dhcpd_sites/`, you have to edit the file
:file:`/etc/dhcp/dhcpd_extra.conf` and add the according include statement like::

    include "/etc/dhcp/dhcpd_sites/dhcpd_siteXXX.conf";
    include "/etc/dhcp/dhcpd_sites/dhcpd_lanDATA.conf";


Adjusting Options of the DHCP server
------------------------------------

Once you have created the subnet in the DHCP server, you must edit each configuration file (the
files in :file:`/etc/dhcp/dhcpd_sites/`) and modify the different parameters.  In section
**subnet**, write the IP subnet and change the following options (underlined fields in the
example)::

    subnet 172.30.8.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {

* subnet-mask::

    option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;

* broadcast-address::

    option broadcast-address 172.30.8.255;

* routers (specify the IP address of the router that will be the default gateway of the site)::

    option routers 172.30.8.1;

In section **pool**, modify the options::

    pool {

* log (add the name of the site or of the subnet)::

    log(concat("[", binary-to-ascii(16, 8, ":", hardware), "] POOL VoIP Site XXX"));

* range (it will define the range of IP address the DHCP server can use to address the devices of
  that subnet)::

    range 172.30.8.10 172.30.8.200;


.. warning:: Wazo only answers to DHCP requests from :ref:`supported devices <devices>`. In case of
   you need to address other equipment, use the option *allow unknown-clients;* in the
   :file:`/etc/dhcp/dhcpd_sites/` files


At this point, you can apply the changes of the DHCP server with the command::

    service isc-dhcp-server restart

After that, Wazo will start to serve the DHCP requests of the devices located on other sites or
other subnets than the VOIP subnet. You will see in :file:`/var/log/daemon.log` all the DHCP
requests received and how they are handled by Wazo.
