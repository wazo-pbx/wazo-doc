=============
xivo-sysconfd
=============

xivo-sysconfd is the system configuration server for Wazo. It does quite a few different things;
here's a non exhaustive list:

* configuring network (interfaces, hostname, DNS)
* configuring high availability
* staring/stopping/restarting services
* reloading asterisk configuration
* sending some events to components (wazo-agentd)

Configuration File
==================

Default location: ``/etc/xivo/sysconfd.conf``. Format: INI.

The default location may be overwritten by the command line options.

Here's an example of the configuration file:

::

   [general]
   xivo_config_path = /etc/xivo
   templates_path = /usr/share/xivo-sysconfd/templates
   custom_templates_path = /etc/xivo/sysconfd/custom-templates
   backup_path = /var/backups/xivo-sysconfd

   [resolvconf]
   hostname_file = /etc/hostname
   hostname_update_cmd = /etc/init.d/hostname.sh start
   hosts_file = /etc/hosts
   resolvconf_file = /etc/resolv.conf

   [network]
   interfaces_file = /etc/network/interfaces

   [wizard]
   templates_path = /usr/share/xivo-config/templates
   custom_templates_path = /etc/xivo/custom-templates

   [commonconf]
   commonconf_file = /etc/xivo/common.conf
   commonconf_cmd = /usr/sbin/xivo-update-config
   commonconf_monit = /usr/sbin/xivo-monitoring-update

   [openssl]
   certsdir = /var/lib/xivo/certificates

   [monit]
   monit_checks_dir = /usr/share/xivo-monitoring/checks
   monit_conf_dir = /etc/monit/conf.d

   [request_handlers]
   synchronous = false

   [bus]
   username = guest
   password = guest
   host = localhost
   port = 5672
   exchange_name = xivo
   exchange_type = topic
   exchange_durable = true


request_handlers section
------------------------

synchronous
   If this option is true, when xivo-sysconfd receives a request to reload the dialplan for
   example, it will wait for the dialplan reload to complete before replying to the request.

   When this option is false, xivo-sysconfd reply to the request immediately.

   Setting this option to false will speed up some operation (for example, editing a user from the
   web interface or from wazo-confd), but this means that there will be a small delay (up to a few
   seconds in the worst case) between the time you create your user and the time you can dial
   successfully its extension.
