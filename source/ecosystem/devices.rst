   supported_devices

The supported devices page lists, for each vendor, a table that shows
the various features supported by Wazo. Here's an example:

+--------------------------------------------+---------+---------+--------------+
|                                            | Model X | Model Y | Model Z      |
+============================================+=========+=========+==============+
| Provisioning                               | Y       | Y       | Y            |
+--------------------------------------------+---------+---------+--------------+
| H-A                                        | Y       | Y       | Y            |
+--------------------------------------------+---------+---------+--------------+
| Directory XIVO                             | N       | Y       | Y            |
+--------------------------------------------+---------+---------+--------------+
| Funckeys                                   | 0       | 2       | 8            |
+--------------------------------------------+---------+---------+--------------+
|                                            | **Supported programmable keys**  |
+--------------------------------------------+---------+---------+--------------+
| User with supervision function             | Y       | Y       | Y            |
+--------------------------------------------+---------+---------+--------------+

The rows have the following meaning:

Provisioning
   Is the device supported by the :ref:`auto-provisioning <provisioning>` system?

H-A
   Is the device supported by the :ref:`high availability <high-availability>` system?

Directory XiVO
   Is the device supported by the :ref:`remote directory <remote-directory>`? In other word, is it
   possible to consult the XiVO's remote directory from the device?

Funckeys
   How many function keys can be configured on the device from the Wazo web interface?

   The number of function keys that can be configured on a device is not necessarily the same as
   the number of physical function keys the device has. For example, an Aastra 6757i has 12 physical
   keys but you can configure 30 function keys because of the page system.

Inside a table, the following legend is used:

* Y = Yes / Supported
* N = No / Not supported
* NT = Not tested
* NYT = Not yet tested

Each table also contains a section about the supported function keys. In that section, the following
legend can also be used:

* FK = Funckey
* SK = SoftKey
* HK = HardKey
* MN = Menu

Function keys work using the extensions. It is important to enable the function keys you want to
use. Also, the enable transfer option in the user configuration must be enabled to use transfer
function keys.
