**********************
High Availability (HA)
**********************

The :abbr:`HA (High Availability)` solution in Wazo makes it possible to maintain basic telephony
function whether your main Wazo server is running or not. When running a Wazo HA cluster, users are
guaranteed to never experience a downtime of more than 5 minutes of their basic telephony service.

The HA solution in Wazo is based on a 2-nodes "master and slave" architecture. In the normal
situation, both the master and slave nodes are running in parallel, the slave acting as a "hot
standby", and all the telephony services are provided by the master node. If the master fails or
must be shutdown for maintenance, then the telephony devices automatically communicate with the
slave node instead of the master one. Once the master is up again, the telephony devices failback to
the master node. Both the failover and the failback operation are done automatically, i.e. without
any user intervention, although an administrator might want to run some manual operations after
failback as to, for example, make sure any voicemail messages that were left on the slave are copied
back to the master.


Prerequisites
=============

The HA in Wazo only works with telephony devices (i.e. phones) that support
the notion of a primary and backup telephony server.

* Phones must be able to reach the master and the slave (take special care if master and slave are
  not in the same subnet)
* If firewalling, the master must be allowed to join the slave on ports 22 and 5432
* If firewalling, the slave must be allowed to join the master with an ICMP ping
* Trunk registration timeout (``expiry``) should be less than 300 seconds (5 minutes)
* The slave must have no provisioning plugins installed.

The HA solution is guaranteed to work correctly with :ref:`the following devices <devices>`.


Quick Summary
=============

* You need two configured Wazo (wizard passed)
* Configure one Wazo as a master -> setup the slave address (VoIP interface)
* Restart services (wazo-service restart) on master
* Configure the other Wazo as a slave -> setup the master address (VoIP interface)
* Configure file synchronization by running the script ``xivo-sync -i`` on the master
* Start configuration synchronization by running the script ``xivo-master-slave-db-replication
  <slave_ip>`` on the master
* Resynchronize all your devices

That's it, you now have a HA configuration, and every hour all the configuration done on the master
will be reported to the slave.


Configuration Details
=====================

First thing to do is to :ref:`install 2 Wazo <installation>`.

.. important:: When you upgrade a node of your cluster, you must also upgrade the other so that
   they both are running the same version of Wazo. Otherwise, the replication might not work
   properly.

You must configure the :abbr:`HA (High Availability)` with ``PUT /ha``

You can configure the master and slave in whatever order you want.

You must also run ``xivo-sync -i`` on the master to setup file synchronization.  Running ``xivo-sync
-i`` will create a passwordless SSH key on the master, stored under the :file:`/root/.ssh` directory,
and will add it to the :file:`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the slave. The following directories
will then be rsync'ed every hour:

* /etc/asterisk/extensions_extra.d
* /etc/xivo/asterisk
* /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin
* /var/lib/asterisk/moh
* /var/lib/wazo/sounds/tenants

.. warning:: When the HA is configured, some changes will be automatically
   made to the configuration of Wazo.

SIP expiry value on master and slave will be automatically updated:

* ``GET /asterisk/sip/general``

  * ``minexpiry``: 3 minutes
  * ``maxexpiry``: 5 minutes
  * ``defaultexpiry``: 4 minutes

The provisioning server configuration will be automatically updated in order to allow
phones to switch from Wazo power failure.

* ``GET /provd/cfg_mgr/configs?q={"X_type": "registrar"}``

  ``registrar_backup``: <slave ip>
  ``proxy_backup``: <slave ip>

.. warning:: Do not change these values when the HA is configured, as this may cause problems.
   These values will be reset to blank when the HA is disabled.

.. important:: For the telephony devices to take the new proxy/registrar settings
   into account, you must resynchronize the devices or restart them manually.


Master node
-----------

In choosing the ``node_type: master`` you must enter the ``remote_address`` **of the VoIP interface** of the slave node.

.. important:: You have to restart all services (wazo-service restart) once the master node is configured.


Slave node
----------

In choosing the ``node_type: slave`` you must enter the ``remote_address`` **of the VoIP interface** of the master node.


Replication Configuration
-------------------------

Once master slave configuration is completed, Wazo configuration is replicated from the master node
to the slave every hour (:00).

Replication can be started manually by running the replication scripts on the master::

   xivo-master-slave-db-replication <slave_ip>
   xivo-sync

The replication does not copy the full Wazo configuration of the master. Notably, these
are excluded:

* All the network configuration
* All the support configuration
* Call logs
* Call center statistics
* Certificates
* HA settings
* Provisioning configuration
* Voicemail messages

Less importantly, these are also excluded:

* Queue logs
* CELs


Internals
=========

4 scripts are used to manage services and data replication.

* xivo-master-slave-db-replication <slave_ip> is used on the master to replicate the master's
  data on the slave server. It runs on the master.
* xivo-manage-slave-services {start,stop} is used on the slave to start, stop monit and asterisk.
  The services won't be restarted after an upgrade or restart.
* xivo-check-master-status <master_ip> is used to check the status of the master and enable or
  disable services accordingly.
* xivo-sync is used to sync directories from master to slave.


Limitations
===========

When the master node is down, some features are not available and some behave a bit
differently. This includes:

* Call history / call records are not recorded.
* Voicemail messages saved on the master node are not available.
* Custom voicemail greetings recorded on the master node are not available.
* Phone provisioning is disabled, i.e. a phone will always keep the same configuration, even after
  restarting it.
* Phone remote directory is not accessible, because provisioned IP address points to the master.

Note that, on failover and on failback:

* DND, call forwards, call filtering, ..., statuses may be lost if changed recently.
* If you are connected as an agent, then you might need to reconnect as an agent
  when the master goes down.

Additionally, only on failback:

* Voicemail messages are not copied from the slave to the master, i.e. if someone
  left a message on your voicemail when the master was down, you won't be able to
  consult it once the master is up again.
* More generally, custom sounds are not copied back. This includes recordings.

Here's the list of limitations that are more relevant on an administrator standpoint:

* The master status is up or down, there's no middle status. This mean that if Asterisk is crashed
  the Wazo is still up and the failover will NOT happen.
