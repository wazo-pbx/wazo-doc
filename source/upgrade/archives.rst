*************************************
Upgrade to a specific version of Wazo
*************************************

What is the point?
==================

Sometimes, you may need to upgrade your Wazo to a specific version, in case you don't want
to upgrade to the latest (which is not recommended, but sometimes necessary).

Prerequisites
=============

.. warning:: These procedures are *complementary* to the upgrade procedure listed in
             :ref:`version_specific_upgrade`. You must follow the version-specific procedure
             *before* running the following procedures.

Before starting the upgrade, you must have a xivo or Wazo version greater than 14.18.
