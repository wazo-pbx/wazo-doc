*****************
Post Installation
*****************

Here are a few configuration options that are commonly changed once the installation is completed.
Please note that these changes are optional.


Display called name on internal calls
=====================================

When you call internally another phone of the system you would like your phone to display the name
of the called person (instead of the dialed number only).
To achieve this you must change the following SIP options:

* ``PUT /asterisk/sip/general``

    * ``trustrpid``: ``yes``
    * ``sendrpid``: ``pai``


.. _callerid_num_normalization:

Incoming caller number display
==============================

The caller ID number on incoming calls depends on what is sent by your operator.
You can modify it via the file :file:`/etc/xivo/asterisk/xivo_in_callerid.conf`.

.. note:: The reverse directory lookup use the caller ID number after it has been modified by
          :file:`xivo_in_callerid.conf`

Examples:

* If you use a prefix to dial outgoing numbers (like a 0) you should add a 0 to all the ``add =``
  sections,
* You may want to display incoming numbers in E.164 format. For example, you can change the
  ``[national1]`` section to::

    callerid = ^0[1-9]\d{8}$
    strip = 1
    add = +33

To enable the changes you have to restart wazo-agid::

    service wazo-agid restart


Time and date
=============

* Configure your locale and default time zone device template with ``xivo-provd`` endpoint
  ``/provd/cfg_mgr/config`` by editing the default template
* If needed, reconfigure your timezone for the system::

    dpkg-reconfigure tzdata


Codecs
======

You should also select default codecs. It obviously depends on the telco links, the country, the
phones, the usage, etc.
Here is a typical example for Europe (the main goal in this example is to select *only* ``alaw``
instead of both ``alaw`` and ``ulaw`` by default):

* ``PUT /asterisk/sip/general``

    * ``allow``: ``alaw,g722,g729,h264``

* ``PUT /asterisk/iax/general``

    * ``allow``: ``alaw,g722,g729,h264``
